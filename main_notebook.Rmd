## R6 differences

--R6 methods belong to objects, not generics.

--R6 objects are mutable: the usual copy-on-modify semantics do not apply.

The definition of a class is below. The name of the class _must_ coinside on the left and on the right. Naming convention: R6 classes use UpperCamelCase, methods and fields use snake_case. 

```{r}
library(R6)

Accumulator <- R6Class("Accumulator", list(
  sum = 0,
  add = function(x = 1) {
    self$sum <- self$sum + x 
    invisible(self)
  })
)
```

This was an example from Wickham, here's an example from Mailund:

```{r}
library(R6)

VectorStack <- R6Class("VectorStack",
                       private = list(elements = Null),
                       public = list(
                         top = function() {
                           private$elements[1]
                         },
                         pop = function() {
                           private$elements[-1]
                           invisible(self)
                         },
                         push = function(e) {
                           private$elements <-
                             c(e, private$elements)
                           invisible(self)
                         },
                         is_empty = function() {
                           length(private$elements) == 0
                         }
                       ))
```

So, what Wickham doesn't say is that private and public should be there as above.
