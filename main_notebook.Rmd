## R6 differences

--R6 methods belong to objects, not generics.

--R6 objects are mutable: the usual copy-on-modify semantics do not apply.

## R6 class definition

The definition of a class is below. The name of the class (on the right) _must_ be assigned into a variable (on the left) with the same name, this creates an R6 object and defines a class . Naming convention: R6 classes use UpperCamelCase, methods and fields use snake_case. 

```{r}
library(R6)

Accumulator <- R6Class("Accumulator", list(
  sum = 0,
  add = function(x = 1) {
    self$sum <- self$sum + x 
    invisible(self)
  })
)
```

This was an example from Wickham, here's an example from Mailund:

```{r}
library(R6)

VectorStack <- R6Class("VectorStack",
                       private = list(elements = NULL),
                       public = list(
                         top = function() {
                           private$elements[1]
                         },
                         pop = function() {
                           private$elements[-1]
                           invisible(self)
                         },
                         push = function(e) {
                           private$elements <-
                             c(e, private$elements)
                           invisible(self)
                         },
                         is_empty = function() {
                           length(private$elements) == 0
                         }
                       ))
```

So, what Wickham didn't say is that the basic model is with private and public there as in the example above.

The first argument is the class name the other two arguments (public and private) are lists of methods and attributes. The main rule, demonstrated above is:
"In methods, you can access elements in the public list using the variable self, and you can access attributes in the private list using the variable private."

There is also an optional list 'active' for active bindings and an 'inherit' generator (see below).

## The construction of an R6 class object

You construct a new object from the class by calling the new() method. Methods belong to R6 objects so you use $ (because it's a list) to access new():

```{r}
x <- Accumulator$new()   # constructor

# to invoke methods 
x$add(4) 
x$sum
```
In order to be able to chain methods like ...$add(1)$add(3)... you need to return self invisibly.

## Initialize and print methods

$initialize() overrides the default behaviour of $new(). $initialize() is a good place to check that the variables passed to the object are the correct types, because nobody else will check that.

```{r}
Person <- R6Class(classname = "Person", 
  public = list(
    name = NULL,
    age = NA,
    initialize = function(name, age = NA) {
      stopifnot(is.character(name), length(name) == 1)
      stopifnot(is.numeric(age), length(age) == 1)
    
      self$name <- name
      self$age <- age
  },
  print = function(...) {
    cat("Person: \n")
    cat("  Name: ", self$name, "\n", sep = "")
    cat("  Age:  ", self$age, "\n", sep = "")
    invisible(self)
  }
))

alex <- Person$new("Alex", age = 62)
print(alex)
```

## Inheritance

Just add the class as a value of inherit variable, then use 'super' to reference its methods.

```{r}
AccumulatorChatty <- R6Class("AccumulatorChatty", 
  inherit = Accumulator,
  public = list(
    add = function(x = 1) {
      cat("Adding ", x, "\n", sep = "")
      super$add(x = x)
    }
  )
)

x2 <- AccumulatorChatty$new()
x2$add(10)$add(1)$sum
```

## Active fields

they look like fields but are results of hidden methods

```{r}
Rando <- R6::R6Class("Rando", active = list(
  random = function(value) {
    runif(1)       # uniform distribution from stats
  }
))
x <- Rando$new()
x$random
x$random
```

## Assignment and cloning

When R6 object is assigned no copy is created. If you want a separate object you need to $clone() it.

Note that $clone() does not recursively clone nested R6 objects. If you want that, you’ll need to use $clone(deep = TRUE). Note that this only clones R6 objects: if you have other fields with reference semantics (e.g. environments) you’ll need to define your own $clone().

## Finalizer

The $finalize() method is invoked on deletion or by the gc.
