## R6 differences

--R6 methods belong to objects, not generics.

--R6 objects are mutable: the usual copy-on-modify semantics do not apply.

The definition of a class is below. The name of the class (on the right) _must_ be assigned into a variable (on the left) with the same name, this creates an R6 object and defines a class . Naming convention: R6 classes use UpperCamelCase, methods and fields use snake_case. 

```{r}
library(R6)

Accumulator <- R6Class("Accumulator", list(
  sum = 0,
  add = function(x = 1) {
    self$sum <- self$sum + x 
    invisible(self)
  })
)
```

This was an example from Wickham, here's an example from Mailund:

```{r}
library(R6)

VectorStack <- R6Class("VectorStack",
                       private = list(elements = NULL),
                       public = list(
                         top = function() {
                           private$elements[1]
                         },
                         pop = function() {
                           private$elements[-1]
                           invisible(self)
                         },
                         push = function(e) {
                           private$elements <-
                             c(e, private$elements)
                           invisible(self)
                         },
                         is_empty = function() {
                           length(private$elements) == 0
                         }
                       ))
```

So, what Wickham didn't say is that private and public should be there as in the example above.

The first argument is the class name the other two arguments (public and private) are lists of methods and attributes. The main rule, demonstrated above is:
"In methods, you can access elements in the public list using the variable self, and you can access attributes in the private list using the variable private."

There is also an optional list 'active' for active bindings and an 'inherit' generator (see below).
